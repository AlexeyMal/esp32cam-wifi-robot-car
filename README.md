Drive and see the video from the car with your Android phone or tablet!
I have extended the car software (must be programmed to ESP32-CAM in Arduino IDE) to support the motor speed control unsing the (servo-) slider in the app.

Hardware (see photo):
- ESP32-CAM module (buy the one with the USB connector board to programm it)
- Motor shield, e.g. "Deek-Robot stepper motor shield v1" or LN298N motor shield
- Smart car chassis
- 6xAA battery case
- wires

Use this App to control your car:
